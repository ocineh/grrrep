# mini grep
**Version 0.0.1**

this is a simplified version of the grep command done in rust, this is one of the practical work in the rust course that I am following.

## Usage
To use mini-grep you need to run the command with two arguments the first being text and the second being the file to look for the text in, example :
```bash
mini_grep [-i] <text> <filename>
```
These are all the options available at the moment
```
Pattern selection :
-i, --ignore-case       ignore case distinctions in patterns and data
```
